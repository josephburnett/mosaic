# mosaic

## Overview

A photo mosaic is an image composed of many smaller images (see the [Wikipedia arcticle][wiki]).  This project generates a photo mosaic of the target image from a collection of tiles, which are the source images broken into squares of equal size.

## Usage

    lein run [target image] [source images]...
    lein run target.jpg tiles/*.jpg
    lein run --tile-size 100 --tile-step 20 --samples 3 --output "example-output.txt" --width 50 target.jpg tiles/*.jpg
    lein run --help

## Known Issues

* The heavy weigh operations like tile generation and tile matching could make use of multiple cores by using pmap instead of map.
